# About me

Hi! My name is Luis Martínez.

In August 2018 I decided to become a web developer (<nuxt-link to="/blog/from-jobless-to-junior-frontend-developer-in-5-months">learn about how I did it</nuxt-link>).

Things I've done as a web developer:

- Web apps with **VueJS**
- SSR sites with **Nuxt**
- Styling with **Tailwind CSS** and Bootstrap 4 / Vue Bootstrap

I also know a little about PostCSS, React, NodeJS/Express, serverless and AWS, SCSS and Google sheets / Google Apps Script.

Things I've done in past lives:

- a PhD in science. 🤓
- Working as a project manager in IT.
- A kickstarter. 🎲
- As a little kid I loved drawing. 🎨 I still do.

I like:

- Jojo and Star Wars memes
- Dark souls
- Imagining that I can design proper user interfaces 🤷‍♂️

My secret regret: not having started learning web development 10 years earlier.
