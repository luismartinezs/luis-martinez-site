# About me

Hi! My name is Luis Martínez.

In August 2018 I decided to become a web developer.

Currently, I make web apps with Vue.js, a very easy to use and learn Frontend JavaScript framework.

I have also done a few things with React. I work with HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap 4. I also work with Node.js/Express.js, serverless and Google Apps Script. All my projects are showcased either in my Github or on Codepen.

Things I've done in past lives:

- a PhD in science. 🤓
- Working as a project manager in IT.
- A kickstarter. 🎲
- As a little kid I loved drawing. 🎨 I still do.

Other things I like: [FromSoftware video games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTjJFJc1AfY&list=PLrVlvcyP9YsAAqlTw2Mu_gbcoZanM3vHq) 🎮, [craft beer](http://edgebrewing.com/beer/hoptimista/) 🍺, summer and beach 🏖, [Wim Hof method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhr0EvJMNX8). ❄

My secret regret: not having started learning the web development.
