SC2 outline

- Lessons taken from SC2
  - That can be applied to life and learning programming
  - I'm not good at Starcraft2, but I know how the game goes
    - Much of the following ideas come from watching Lowko and Day9 videos
  - Maybe I can learn this from any other hobby
    - But Starcraft 2 is unique in the sense that it balances two concepts: micro and macro
      - Macro and micro might be the most important and general concepts of the game
      - Macro can be broadly qualified as "important things"
        - Need to do them over an over and have compound effect on your game
          - Not doing them is equivalent to putting yourself in a bad position in life from which you have a hard time escaping.
      - Micro can be broadly qualified as "urgent things"
        - Need split second reaction time, either do right now or don't do them
          - Not doing them is more or less equivalent to letting small bad things happen
            - Good macro far outweights good micro
  - I was thinking "how can one become a better developer?"

- 1. Reshape your goals into something useful
  - Goal != winning this game
  - Goal == focus on practicing one single skill until it becomes second nature
    - No other way of measuring success matters, internal or external.

- 2. Review your mistakes
  - Look back at how you have done things, particularly your mistakes.
    - Be critical with yourself
      - But don't punish yourself for your mistakes
      - And don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to how you were yesterday
        - We're all human
  - You're alwys responsible for your mistakes
    - The cause is always something **you** did badly
      - Figure that out and fix it

- 3. Look at the "first cause"
  - From Day9
  - When something goes wrong, don't look at the thing that happened immediately before to find the cause. Look back at the first thing you did wrong that led to the failure, and fix that.

- 4. Establish habits designed to move you forward in life.
  - Starcraft has "macro cycles", actions repeated every few seconds that push forward your economy
    - Build workers, build more supply, train army, build new structures, scout the enemy
    - Not doing those would mean your economic productivity doesn't grow, you use resources very inefficiently and you lack intel
      - In short, you would be helplessly lost in a mess you created
  - The macro cycles of life would be a set of habits that are repeated every X hours or days or weeks.
    - For example: exercising, investing, reading, writing...
  - Don't let your life be a mess
  - Don't go aimless on your day to day, without knowing what to do. Set habits mindfully

- 4.5 Put your habits in autopilot
  - You already made the decision whether to do them, so just do them
    - That will remove the need to decide whether you should do them
    - It will free "decision-making energy" to spend in other things that are not habits

- 5. Give your habits (macro) priority over "urgent" stuff that shows up daily (micro)
  - Life gets in the way of your plans constantly
    - Improvise a party
    - A friend tells you to go out and you do
    - Someone calls you out of the blue
    - Something breaks and you need to fix it
  - Don't let the little stuff in life keep on distracting you from staying on top of your habits

- 6. The default lifestyle is "badly optimized", purposefully tweak your lifestyle.
  - Starcraft comes out of the box with default keyboard shortcuts, or hotkeys, to play.
    - These are ineffective and can generate bad habits
      - You change them to play more effectively
  - In real life, the default lifestyle seems to be: "spend most of your time working in a boring job, spend most of your money in stuff you could do without, rinse and repeat".
  - Look for someone who has their lilfestyle better configured
    - That would be: Pro-gamers
      - In real life, this could be one or more persons you admire that are in a better life stiuation professionally, economically or in any other dimension
    - Copy them, as a good first step
    - Don't get stuck in how they do things, tweak it to what fits you best over time

- 7. Get rid of bad habits.
  - In starcraft, pressing F2 selects all your army units.
    - It is considered a bad thing to do, but it's tempting for beginners to do it because it's easy
      - If you rely on this, a bad habit will develop that will get in the way of improving
        - You will have to "unlearn" the bad habit to progress
  - Find what things you do often lead to a waste of time and energy, and get rid of those.
    - You will probably feel awkward or suffer through abstinence

- 8. Understand that doing a complex thing well might look almost impossible initally, but it's very possible
  - Shift your mindset:
    - Do not try to learn all the aspects of the skill at the same time
    - Pick one small thing and learn to do that
      - Allow yourself to suck at everything else
      - Practice that small thing until it becomes second nature, "muscle memory"
        - Until you've done it so many times that you don't even have to think
        - Muscle memory allows you to do something without even thinking, freeing more brain power to learn the next thing

- 9. Accept that practicing a new thing will at first feel very awkward and difficult.
  - You will feel unconfortable and feel that you suck
  - Simply push through that phase without judging yourself

- 10. Focus on practiting often
  - The more you practice, the better
  - Don't let lots of time go between your practice sessions
    - Practice daily

- 11. Do mentally demanding tasks when your mind is sharp
  - Otherwise rest, or do something easier
  - Without a fresh and rested mind, you can't perform
  - We live in a society that seems to be stubbornly obsessed with productivity and hard work. Burning down the midnight oil
    - That is damaging the quality of whatever you're doing
  - If you are sleepy or tired and force yourself to do something intellectually demanding, your performance will go down in terms of speed and quality.
    - In such cases, it's much better to take a rest, sleep, take a walk... switch your brain off for a while

- 12. Accept that losing is part of the game
  - Accept loss without feeling even a it bad, loss is inevitable
  - When you realize you can't win, accept it, give up and move on to the next game
    - No point in spending energy and time in something lost

- 13. Your skill at doing something is really your skill at doing it in less than ideal circumstances.
  - Real life is unpredictable and things break and fail that shouldn't
    - That's the normal playground, not an ideal scenario where things go to plan
    - Level up your skill so that it is sufficient to deal with real-life problems, not with hypotheticals where everything goes well
    - When shit hits the fan, don't freak out, because that's normal and expected
      - Stay calm, do your best
        - Pick up the pieces after the storm
      - Don't feel like you're unprepared or a failure and don't panic
    - Expect your successes to be messy, not elegant
