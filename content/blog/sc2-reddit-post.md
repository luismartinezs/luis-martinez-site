Although I didn't really learn, I love starcraft. Forever I thought that some lessons you learn from the game can be adapted to real life, and I decided to write them down.

Lots of this comes from Lowko and Day9 content.

Please let me know where you agree / disagree, what you think is missing.

Lessons from SC2 that can be applied to real life:

Reshape your goals. Do not have winning a given game as your goal. Have improving and having fun as a goal. Don't define failure as "I didn't win this thing", but instead "I practiced XXX skill and I became better as a result (if I keep on it, I will win more in the long run)". That is your only goal for a game. Don't care about other ways of measuring success, external or internal.

Look back at how you have done things, and be critical of your mistakes. Whether you lose or win something, the reason is always something that you did well or bad. Figure that out. Learning from one loss is more important than one win.

Principle of first cause. When something goes wrong, don't look at the thing that happened immediately before to find the cause. Look back at the first thing you did wrong that led to the failure, and fix that.

Establish habits (a macro cycle) that are designed to achieve your long term goal. Imaigne you're playing SC2 and you don't even know what your macro cycle is. You will forget to build workers, army, upgrades, scouting... your economy will become a mess and you will be helpless. Don't let the same thing happen in real life. Don't go aimless in your day to day without knowing what to do. Set habits mindfully.

Give your habits (macro cycle) priority over the "urgent" stuff that shows up every day (micro).

"Normal lifestyle" (default keyboard shortcuts) is generally speaking not very efficient. Look for someone who has their life configuration better setup in a way you like (pro gamers), and just copy them. That's a good starting point, but don't get stuck in what they do. Over time, find what works best for you.

Identify and eliminate bad habits (e.g. F2 instead of control groups) and useless resource and time sinks that slow you down.

Understand that doing a complex thing well, even if it looks impossible when you start, is very possible. Instead of improving at it generally, improve in one small aspect at a time, ignoring the rest. Practice a lot until it becomes muscle memory and you don't even have to think about it, so that brain power is freed to practice the next thing.

Accept that practicing a new thing will at first feel very awkward and difficult, and just push through that phase.

Focus on practicing as many hours a day as possible.
