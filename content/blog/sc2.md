# What lessons from Starcraft 2 can be applied to real life

Starcraft 2 is an RTS. A very fun and good one, in my opinion. I loved Starcraft and Starcraft 2 since I was a kid. I never really learned to play it in a competitive level, but I know enough about how it works.

I've played quite a bit, I've tried to learn a bit, and I've listened to youtubers who explain how to learn. Most notorioulsy, [Day9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaxar6TBM-94_ezoS00fLkA) (waaay back in the day) and [Lowko](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZNTsLA6t6bRoj-5QRmqt_w).

THere's a real learning process and qualities of it that forever has caught my attention as something valuable beyond video games.

These are some of the knowledge I abstracted and adapted for a more generic game (real life) from vidoes I watched.

Take it seriously or take it as a fun exercise. In any case, enjoy.

They are in the context of **learning** a very complex skill, so complex that it might feel impossible or frustrating, in a competitive environment. And also about some generalities of life.

This is actually very relevant to programming and something I struggle often. I hope this is therefore some good food for thought.

## Mindset

### Set the correct goals

Turn around the way you set goals.

Have improving and having fun as a goal, not winning.

Having "winning" as a goal can be useless. If your goal is winning at something and you fail, you will feel frustrated and will stop. You might be overwhelmed and lack focus.

If your goal is to become a good developer, you might be overwhelmed in front of such an arduous task.

Instead, deconstruct the goal into pieces. This is no secret, I've heard it many times, probably you did too. Focus on improving one single thing at a time, and forget about the rest.

Redefine your goal or success condition in your own terms. What are you trying to improve on? Your goal is to focus on that one thing you want to improve on while ignoring the rest. If you successfully do that, you win because you achieved you goal. Even if you lost that game.

Life is not about winning or losing a game, it's more about winning more and more games over time.

Learning from a loss is more important than a win.

// TODO muscle memory

Example:

My goal is to be a good developer. Good developers know how to code. Plus their code is easy to understand and ordered. This means that they use functional programming (just hypothetically). So every function is short, pure and does one and only one thing. Ok, so whatever I do today, I won't write a function that is more than 20 lines long and does more than what it's name says, no matter what.

This is a shift in mindset. From "being a good developer" to something actually useful.

### Review, look back

And be critical of your mistakes.

In Starcraft they say: "no matter what happened or against who you play, if you lost the game it was YOUR fault."

There's always a point where you did something that led you to lose that game.

Reviewing past games is an exteremely important part of improving. Where are you failing? What is actually causing you to lose? What's the thing that is limiting you the most? How could you have "won"?

But don't beat yourself up for your mistakes. We all do mistakes, it's human.

### All strategies aree a valid part of the game

## Macro and micro

There are two concepts in Starcraft, macro, or the things that you do to keep your economy and production running, and micro, or the way you micromanage your units in the map.

You can think about them more or less like "strategy" and "tactics", or perhaps more accurately, "important" and "urgent" things.

Macro provides resources. Without resources all the skill in the world is useless. So macro wins.

I understand macro in terms of things that promote long term wellness and benefits, like healthy eating, exercise, a good working station, confortable finances, loving relationships, stress management, sleep, and things that you either have to or want to do over and over. We simply can't function properly without caring about these, or we can't advance.

I understand micro in terms of all the little "bullshit" that shows up moment to moment, like distractions, appointments, calls, something breaking at home, etc.

The lessons that I extracted from Starcraft are essentially 2:

1. Prioritize the important (macro) over the urgent (micro). If you neglect the important you're almost guaranteed to end up in a bad place. Literally push aside anything in favor of the important (whatever you decide the important is)
2. Try to optimize or automate or facilitate the things you do over an over as much as possible.

How to go about number 1?

In Starcraft there's something called "macro rotations". This is a series of tasks that you have to do routinely every few seconds to keep your macro healthy. Translated to real life, this results in what one might call "habit rotations", and these, like macro in the game, take priority over anything else, because they are the most important things you do to keep things afloat.

Let's see a simple example: I've decided that a number of tasks take priority (macro).

- Don't sit too much
- Learn to type in the keyboard properly
- Do anki reviews
- Write (like I'm doing right now)
- Read

For each of these I set a **habit** I do routinely, and for each habit I set a **timer**. Every time the habit goes off, I can do the habit, and allow myself to give it **priority** over anything else I'm doing. That is my "habit rotation".

- Do one minute of squats. timer: 30 minutes
- Use keybr.com to practice typing, focusing on not doing mistakes. Timer: 2 hours.
- Review my anki deck. Timer: 1 day.
- Continue writing a blog post. Timer: 1 day.
- Continue reading whatever book I'm reading. Timer: 3 days.

The [multitimer android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jee.timer&hl=en&gl=US) helps me do exactly that.

This actually works.

The next image (from [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/)) is my improvement on typing.

<base-img path="typing-chart_q9ezmm" alt="My typing speed improves dramatically after adding it to my habit rotation"></base-img>

The **red dots** are the number of **errors**, the **green dots** are the typing **speed**. The vertical **yellow line** shows when I started practicing typing as part of my **habit rotation**. The massive improvement is obvious.

Continue with "number 2".
