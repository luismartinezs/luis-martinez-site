# Web Accessibility Guidelines

Ideally, applying a11y (accessibility) guidelines should be a part of the development process, rather than an afterthought.

I propose the following steps:

## Steps to perform an a11y audit

1. Automatic testing

There are a handful of these types of tools. All of them run an audit check and provide a list of things to change. These tools are described here in more detail: https://a11y.coffee/start-testing

- **WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool**: in my opinion it is the tool that gives a quickest and most visual overview. I’d start here. https://wave.webaim.org/
- Additional tools that provide similar information:
  - **Firefox a11y audit** in Firefox developer tools (recommended)
    - In a11y dev tools tab, select: “All issues”, “show tabbing order”, and color deficiency simulations
  - Chrome's lighthouse audit in chrome developer tools
  - Axe browser extension https://www.deque.com/axe/
  - Accessibility insights: https://accessibilityinsights.io/

In my opinion, running one of the above should be enough to cover this point.

1. A11y checklist

Use an a11y checklist to discover issues that automated tools might have overlooked: https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist or https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist

3. Manual testing

Cross-check the following use cases:

- Interactive elements should follow ARIA guidelines: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/
- Each page should be keyboard navigable
- Each page should be screen reader navigable (navigate with closed eyes using keyboard and a screen reader)
- Focus styles should be apparent
- Touch points should have appropriate dimensions on touch device sizes: 48x48pt minimum for touchable areas, and 32pt of space in between touchable elements
- View site in grayscale, make sure it is readable (use nocoffee from the resources section)
- View site in high contrast mode, make sure it is readable (use nocoffee from the resources section)
- View site at 200% magnification
