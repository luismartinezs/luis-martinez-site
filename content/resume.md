# Resume

## tl,dr;

Frontend developer since 2019

- The tech stack I feel at home with: Vue, Nuxt, Tailwind CSS, Storyblok (headless CMS)

- My strenghts:
  - Create component-based, SEO-friendly and accessible user interfaces
  - Turn designs into code
  - Craft clean, reusable, maintainable and well-documented code

- Some projects I've worked on:
  - Internal platform and conferences platform for passionate people: Migrate Nuxt code to a more modern standard (composition API). Extend frontend and backend with new features.
  - Build Nuxt component library that powers campaign pages, with content managed from Storyblok CMS. Making it easy to create new pages without help of the dev team.
  - Build Single page applications (like admin dashboards) powered by Vue 3

- Other tools I've used: Storybook, Bootstrap CSS, PostCSS, React, NodeJS, Google Apps Script / Google Sheets scripts, testing frameworks (jest, testcafe)
