Anki is a software to use flashcards (question and answer cards) on the computer or mobile. I use it to review what I learn when I am studying programming. Anki is an **extremely valuable tool to prevent forgetting what I have studied in the past**.

Thanks to using Anki daily for a long time, I can recall many concepts of javascript and other technologies even if I don't use them in my daily work, and **even if I have never used them**.

Anki reviews are a great way to avoid feeling lost among so many new things to remember while studying programming.

**Anki is particularly useful to effectively digest the fundamentals of programming, when one gets started on this field.**

I will explain how I setup Anki and how I create cards.

If you don't know what Anki is, you can get an overview [here](https://docs.Ankiweb.net/#/getting-started).

## Download Anki

Head to [AnkiWeb](https://apps.Ankiweb.net/) and download the software.

Most likely, you will want to create the cards in your computer and study them in your mobile.

So, download and install both the desktop version and the mobile app for whatever operative systems you use. Once you have installed the app, **create an account**. That will allow you to **synchronize** your cards and decks across devices.

Once you have an account, you'll do some initial setup.

## Initial setup

We're going to setup Anki for the first time. You only need to do this once.

### Create a new deck

You will be adding cards to something called a "deck". The first time you open Anki, you won't have any deck, so you'll have to create one.

Simply click on `Create deck`, and give it a name. Done. Easy, right?

### Customize deck options

Optional, but highly recommended.

The default Anki settings might be "optimal" to memorize things, but have two fairly big disadvantages, in my opinion:

- The review rate for cards is high. This means that you **review a given card quite often**.
- The number of reviews per session is high. In a given (daily) session you will be **reviewing lots of cards**.

This makes the daily review session quite long. In between 20 and 40 minutes, or more. Honestly, I'm too lazy to spend that much time reviewing cards.

So, **I tweaked the settings so that review sessions are shorter.** About 10 to 20 minutes long.

To customize the deck options:

1. Click on the small gear icon next to the deck
2. Select `Options`
3. At the top, next to options group, click on `Manage` and then `Add`
4. Name the new options group whatever you like ("quick review", for example)
5. Use the following options:
