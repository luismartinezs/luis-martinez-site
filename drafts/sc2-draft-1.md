# What can you learn from playing Starcraft 2?

## Is Starcraft 2 relevant at all to web development?

I love Starcraft since 1999.

Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategy game where you must build an economy and an army. Then with this army you beat your opponent. You must juggle your focus between developing your economy (known as "macro") and micro-managing your army (known as "micro"). And [it's not easy](https://youtu.be/bexWuHmV32A?t=669).

Learning to play Starcraft 2 means learning a **very complex skill**. So complex, that it feels almost impossible to do well as a beginner.

Web development is also a **very complex skill**. Lots of moving pieces.

So, as a fan of Starcraft 2, I (naturally) thought:

> How what one can learn from playing Starcraft 2 extrapolate to learning a complex skill, like web development?

And:

> How can I become a better web developer by applying what I learn from Starcraft 2?

In what is perhaps a fun thought experiment more than anything, I came up with the following.

Grab your popcorn and enjoy.


## Redefine "winning" into something that benefits you

Typically, the goal of the game is to defeat the opponent. Turns out, focusing on that goal is not useful to learn to play. That won't help you improve, except by coincidence. You won't know where to focus your energy. Worse. If your goal is winning at something and you fail, you might feel frustrated and stop.

Having the goal to "win the game" is the same as having the goal to "play very well". Too generic and overwhelming. Where to focus? What to do next?

Instead, ask: What is the next thing you need / want to improve on?

Redefine a win as having practiced that one thing with focus, ignoring the rest. That is your success, because by doing this, you will get better at that one thing. And by getting better at that one thing, you'll win more in the long run.

In life winning or losing one game is irrelevant. Increasing your number of wins over time is what matters.

Any one individual loss doesn't matter, because you don't measure success based on that.

## Learning something complex is within your grasp

Faced with a huge task like learning to play Starcraft, or learning web development, might be so daunting that it feels impossible. As if you were in front of an insurmountable mountain.

It isn't.

Understand that no matter complex a skill might look, it is within your grasp to learn it, if you commit and are patient.

Do not try to learn all aspects of a skill at the same time. Focus on one tiny aspect of the skill, and allow yourself to completely suck at everything except at that thing.

Practice one thing at a time.

Practice that one tiny thing many times, until you develop "muscle memory" (the ability to do that well without even thinking about it). As that happens, you'll be able to do that without speding mental energy on that, so you'll be able to focus on the next thing.


## Review your loss and be critical of your mistakes, but be gentle with yourself

When things go wrong, when you lose, look back. No matter how much you want to blame the universe, almost always there's something **you** could have done to prevent losing.

So be critical of yourself and don't shy away from your mistakes.

What went wrong? Why? What did you do well despite losing?

Learn what you can from it. Figure out what is causing your losses, and use that knowledge to decide what you need to improve next.

But equally importantly, never beat yourself up for your mistakes. Be gentle with yourself. Mistakes are unavoidable, we're all human. Mistakes are part of the game.

Always remember that learning from a loss is more important than a win.

## Start by fixing the first thing you did wrong

Also known as "the principle of the first cause" (I probably made up that name).

When something goes wrong, we have a tendency to blame whatever happened immediately before the disaster. Don't do that. Right before a loss, things were probably too messed up already due to lots of mistakes being piled up.

Thus, blaming the last thing that happened is like pointing fingers randomly, trying to find the cause of the pain.

So look again, look better, look further back.

Find the first thing you did wrong that led to the failure, and fix **that**.

When you fuck up, ask yourself: "What started this mess?"


# Good habits are king, don't let anything interfere with them

We enter into serious territory.

Starcraft 2 tells you that "good habits" are king, and without them you're hopeless.

In Starcraft 2, players split their attention between macro and micro tasks.

> Macro = grow your economy and spend your resources

> Micro = control and manage your army units in the battlefield

**Macro** is equivalent to important tasks performed over and over whose effect compounds and in the long run mark all the difference. In real life, I think of them as good habits, like exercising, investing and healthy eating. Neglecting them will have a disastrous result years from now.

**Micro** is equivalent to tasks that have an immediate positive effect, but almost always have very little impact in the long run. In real life, I think of these as the little urgent and annoying things that creep in your daily life.

Starcraft 2 shows you that neglecting "macro" to spend more time in "micro" is always a bad idea, and should be avoided. I think this is true in real life too.

Don't let the little stuff in life keep on distracting you from staying on top of your good habits.

## Establish habits designed to move you forward in life

To be on top of macro players do a series of tasks or "rotations" routinely every few seconds. These rotations are known as a "macro cycles".

Thus, success in Stracraft 2 needs good "macro cycles" performed routinely. Success in life too needs "habit rotations" that performed routinely move you forward and lead to good outcomes.

How you define "success in life" is entirely up to you of course.

That is why, unllike in Starcraft 2 where "macro cycles" are more or less predefined, not all "habit rotations" are made equal.

The "macro cycles" of your life would be a set of habits you do repeatedly and that you have purposefully chosen based on your needs and desires.

For example, a very basic "habit rotation" would be:

- Exercise every 3 days
- Fast once a week
- Read 1 hour per day

The point is: don't let your life be a mess. Don't go aimless on your day to day without knowing what to do. On the contrary, mindfuly pick a "habit rotation" and prioritize doing it, because its compound effect will have a profound impact over time.


- Establish good macro cycle - habits
- Get rid of bad habits - habits
- Habits on autopilot - habits
- Practice very often to improve quickly - habits
- Accept that you will suck at first - mindset
- Accept that losing is part of the game - mindset
- Practice when sharp, rest when tired - improve
- Tweak your lifestlye, don't settle for unoptimal - improve
- Over-prepare - improve
