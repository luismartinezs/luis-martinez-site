# What can you learn from playing Starcraft 2?

## Is Starcraft 2 relevant at all to web development?

I love Starcraft since 1999.

Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategy game where you must build an economy and an army. Then with this army you beat your opponent. You must juggle your focus between developing your economy (known as "macro") and micro-managing your army (known as "micro"). And [it's not easy](https://youtu.be/bexWuHmV32A?t=669).

Learning to play Starcraft 2 means learning a **very complex skill**. So complex, that it feels almost impossible to do well as a beginner.

Web development is also a **very complex skill**. Lots of moving pieces.

So, as a fan of Starcraft 2, I (naturally) thought:

> Can I extrapolate what I learn from playing Starcraft 2 to a complex skill, like web development?

And:

> How can I become a better web developer by applying what I learn from Starcraft 2?

In what is perhaps a fun thought experiment more than anything, I came up with the following.

Grab your popcorn and enjoy.


## Redefine "winning" into something that benefits you

Typically, the goal of the game is to defeat the opponent. Turns out, focusing on that goal is not useful to learn to play. That won't help you improve, except by coincidence. You won't know where to focus your energy. Worse. If your goal is winning at something and you fail, you might feel frustrated and stop.

Having the goal to "win the game" is the same as having the goal to "play very well". Too generic and overwhelming. Where to focus? What to do next?

Instead, ask: What is the next thing you need / want to improve on?

Redefine a win as having practiced that one thing with focus, ignoring the rest. That is your success, because by doing this, you will get better at that one thing. And by getting better at that one thing, you'll win more in the long run.

In life winning or losing one game is irrelevant. Increasing your number of wins over time is what matters.

Any one individual loss doesn't matter, because you don't measure success based on that.

## Learning something complex is within your grasp

Faced with a huge task like learning to play Starcraft, or learning web development, might be so daunting that it feels impossible. As if you were in front of an insurmountable mountain.

It isn't.

Understand that no matter how complex a skill might look, it is within your grasp to learn it, if you commit and are patient.

Do not try to learn all aspects of a skill at the same time. Focus on one tiny aspect of the skill, and allow yourself to completely suck at everything except at that thing.

Practice one tiny thing at a time.

Practice that one tiny thing many times, until you develop "muscle memory" (the ability to do that well without even thinking about it). As that happens, you'll be able to do that without speding mental energy on that, so you'll be able to focus on the next thing.


## Review your loss and be critical of your mistakes, but be gentle with yourself

When things go wrong, when you lose, look back. No matter how much you want to blame the universe, almost always there's something **you** could have done to prevent losing.

So be critical of yourself and don't shy away from your mistakes.

What went wrong? Why? What did you do well despite losing?

Learn what you can from it. Figure out what is causing your losses, and use that knowledge to decide what you need to improve next.

But equally importantly, never beat yourself up for your mistakes. Be gentle with yourself. Mistakes are unavoidable, we're all human. Mistakes are part of the game.

Always remember that learning from a loss is more important than a win.

## Start by fixing the first thing you did wrong

Also known as "The Principle of the First Cause" (I probably made up that name).

When something goes wrong, we have a tendency to blame whatever happened immediately before the disaster. Don't do that. Right before a loss, things were probably too messed up already due to lots of mistakes being piled up.

Thus, blaming the last thing that happened is like pointing fingers randomly, trying to find the cause of the pain.

So look again, look better, look further back.

Find the first thing you did wrong that led to the failure, and fix **that**.

When you fuck up, ask yourself: "What started this mess?"


# Good habits are king, don't let anything interfere with them

We enter into serious territory.

Starcraft 2 tells you that "good habits" are king, and without them you're hopeless.

In Starcraft 2, players split their attention between macro and micro tasks.

> Macro = grow your economy and spend your resources

> Micro = control and manage your army units in the battlefield

**Macro** is equivalent to important tasks performed over and over whose effect compounds and in the long run mark all the difference. In real life, I think of them as good habits, like exercising, investing and healthy eating. Neglecting them will have a disastrous result years from now.

**Micro** is equivalent to tasks that have an immediate positive effect, but almost always have very little impact in the long run. In real life, I think of these as the little urgent and annoying things that creep in your daily life.

Starcraft 2 shows you that neglecting "macro" to spend more time in "micro" is always a bad idea, and should be avoided. I think this is true in real life too.

Don't let the little stuff in life distract you from staying on top of what matters.

## Establish habits designed to move you forward in life

To be on top of macro, players do a series of tasks or "rotations" routinely every few seconds. These rotations are known as a "macro cycles".

Thus, success in Stracraft 2 needs good "macro cycles" performed routinely. Success in life too needs "habit rotations" that performed routinely move you forward and lead to good outcomes.

How you define "success in life" is entirely up to you of course.

That is why, unllike in Starcraft 2 where "macro cycles" are more or less predefined, not all "habit rotations" are made equal.

The "macro cycles" of your life would be a set of habits you do repeatedly and that you have purposefully chosen based on your needs and desires.

For example, a very basic "habit rotation" would be:

- Exercise every 3 days
- Fast once a week
- Read 1 hour per day

The point is not however what those should be, but: don't let your life be a mess.

Don't go aimless on your day to day without knowing what to do. On the contrary, mindfuly pick a "habit rotation" and prioritize doing it, because its compound effect will have a profound impact over time.

That connects to the next lesson.

## Get rid of bad habits

In Starcraft 2, F2 selects your entire army. It's very tempting for beginners to do that because it's easy. However, it is a bad habit that will get on the way of improving and will have to be unlearned.

Find the things you do often that get on your way. Things that are a waste of time and energy. It's very tempting to be lazy and to keep on doing things the bad way just because you started doing them that way (maybe you didn't know better).

In the programming world, that goes for example for manual tasks that need to be done over an over. Don't be lazy and write a script to automate them, even if it feels scary because you've never done it before.

In more general terms, it might be things like mindlessly watching YouTube, or playing too many videogames (that time when Starcraft teaches you to stop playing Starcraft...), which detract you from good habits.

Kill or minimize your bad habits. We all have them.

## Put your habits (or your decision about them) on auto-pilot

I know I'm insisting on habits, but I think they're key.

Once you've decided:

- What habits you'll do
- How often you will do each
- That you will give them priority

There's really no decision-making left about that, and it should make things easier. You don't have to think whether you do them or not. And it doesn't matter what else you think you have to do, or whether you're "busy" with something else.

Simply do them.

You will have more "decision-power" to spend on other things.

I suggest that for each habit you set some kind of timer, so that you can keep track of when you have to do them without having to think whether it's the time or not.

The [multitimer android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jee.timer&hl=en&gl=US) works for me.

## To improve quickly, practice often

Practice smart, not hard. Sure. But practice.

And practice often.

Starcraft pro-gamers practice 10 or 12 hours a day. There's probably no need to reach this number of hours when learning programming.

But the simple truth is that lots of cumulative practice will bring you where you want to be faster. You get good at what you do often. The more you practice, the better you'll get.

And frequent practice will help.

Practicing one skill daily, or even multiple times a day, will skyrocket the speed at which you learn. Don't let lots of time go between practice sessions, otherwise the brain kind of resets.

Oppositely, only thinking that you want to be a good developer without follow up action won't bring you anywhere. Make sure you're not in that last group.

## Accept that you will suck at first

When you start practicing a new skill, or anything new that you've never done before and are not familiar with, you will feel unconfortable. This will happen particularly when learning a complex skill composed of many sub-skills, like Starcraft or programming.

You'll feel that you suck. It will feel like going uphill when you only want to slide down into comfort.

Allow yourself to suck. Allow yourself to suck badly, and accept that it is perfectly fine for you to suck now. Because eventually you won't.

Simply push through that phase.

## Accept that losing is part of the game, concede when you can't win

Accept defeat as a natural part of life. Try to win, try to face the odds looking for that chance of victory, even if it's small. Struggle in front of challenges.

But sometimes there's a point when defeat is inevitable, regardless of what you do from that point onwards. In that case, any more energy spent there is a waste.

When you realize you can't win, accept defeat. Give up. Learn from what caused your defeat. And move on to the next chance of winning.

Simple but hard advice.

## Practice when sharp, rest when tired

Without a fresh or rested mind, you can't perform well. Working to exhaustion, burning the midnight oil, can be damaging to the quality of your work.

Do mentally demanding tasks when your mind is sharp. If you are tired, it's much better to take a rest, sleep, take a walk... switch off your brain for a while.

## Tweak your lifestlye, don't settle for unoptimal

Starcraft comes out of the box with default settings. These are ineffective and can lead to bad habits. So what people do is tweak them to be able to play more effectively.

Players generally copy the configuration of a pro-gamer and go from there. Later tweaking their configuration to customize it more to their playstyle, once they understand better how the game works.

Society too seems to be "configured out of the box" with some defaults. In general terms, go to school, go to university, get a job and work for 40 years. Whereas this doesn't need to be terrible, let's not overestimate how good it can be, and realize that you don't need to follow all these things for your life to be good.

Look for "pros": people who are in a situation that you desire. This could be someone freelancing as a web developer in a very successful way, or someone who is physically strong as a result of training.

Copy their lifestlye and the things they do as a first approach. That will automatically put you in a better position than before.

Then don't get forever stuck in doing what they do. Start doing things your way.

## Your skill at doing something is really your skill at doing it in less than ideal circumstances

The controlled environment where you train and practice your skills and real life are two different things. Real life is quite unpredictable and sometimes things break at the worst moment. Sometimes shit hits the fan, the storm hits.

Level up your skill, not to the bare minimum, not to deal with hypotheticals where everything goes according to plan, but to the level where you can deal with messy real-life scenarios.

Over-practice. Over-prepare. Be able to perform on the theoretical scenarios blind-folded.

Then, when shit hits the fan don't freak out, don't feel like a failure, because that's normal. Do your best, then pick up the pieces after the storm.

Don't expect your successes to be elegant, expect them to be messy.
