# What can you learn from playing Starcraft 2?

## Is Starcraft 2 relevant at all to web development?

I love Starcraft since 1999.

Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategy game where you must build an economy and an army. Then with this army you beat your opponent. You must juggle your focus between building your economy and controlling your army. And [it's not easy](https://youtu.be/bexWuHmV32A?t=669).

Learning to play Starcraft 2 means learning a **very complex skill**. So complex, that it feels almost impossible to do well as a beginner.

Web development is also a **very complex skill**. Lots of moving pieces.

So, as a fan of Starcraft 2, I (naturally) thought:

> How what one can learn from playing Starcraft 2 extrapolate to learning a complex skill, like web development?

And:

> How can I become a better web developer by applying what I learn from Starcraft 2?

In what is perhaps a fun thought experiment more than anything, I came up with the following.

Grab your popcorn and enjoy.

## Understand that doing a complex thing well might look almost impossible initally, but it isn't




## Focus on improving one thing at a time

If your goal is to become a good developer, you might be overwhelmed in front of such an arduous task.

Instead, deconstruct the goal into pieces. This is no secret, I've heard it many times, probably you did too. Focus on improving one single thing at a time, and forget about the rest.

## Redefine "winning" into something that benefits you

Typically, the goal of the game is to defeat the opponent. Turns out, focusing on that goal is not useful to learn to play. That won't help you improve, except by coincidence. You won't know where to focus your energy. Worse. If your goal is winning at something and you fail, you might feel frustrated and stop.

What is the one thing you're trying to improve on?

Redefine a win as having practiced that one thing with focus, ignoring the rest. That is your success, because by doing this, you will get better at that one thing, which you need to improve.

After all, in life winning or losing one game is irrelevant. Increasing your number of wins over time is what matters.

Learning from a loss is more important than a win.
